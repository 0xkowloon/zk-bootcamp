What is the size of the smallest possible group? (Remember, a group is a set, so this is asking how large the set is)

The size of the smallest possible group is 1 with the only element in the set being e the identity element

Substituting e for 1 under multiplication as an example,

- closure: 1 * 1 = 1
- associativity (1 * 1) * 1 = 1 * (1 * 1) = 1
- identity: 1 * 1 = 1 (a * e = a with a == e)
- inverse: 1 * 1 = 1 (a * a**-1 = e)

For addition, e is 0

- closure: 0 + 0 = 0
- associativity (0 + 0) + 0 = 0 + (0 + 0) = 0
- identity: 0 + 0 = 0 (a + e = a with a == e)
- inverse: 0 + 0 = 0 (a + -a = e)
