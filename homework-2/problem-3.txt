What algebraic structure (group, monoid, semigroup, etc) is all even integers under addition

It is a group because it fulfills the following requirements:

- closure: 2 even integers under addition results in another even integer, which is also in the group
- associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- having an identity element: 0 is the identity element: a + 0 = a
- having an inverse: for each a, there is an inverse of -a where a + (-a) = 0
